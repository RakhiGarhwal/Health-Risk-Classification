# Health Risk Classification

A machine learning project that predicts a person's health risk category—**Low**, **Medium**, or **High**—based on inputs such as **BMI**, **exercise frequency**, and **eating habits**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses classification techniques to categorize individuals into different health risk levels. The model is trained on health-related features like:

- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
- **Exercise Frequency**
- **Eating Habits**

It aims to assist in preventive healthcare by identifying individuals at potential risk based on lifestyle patterns.
